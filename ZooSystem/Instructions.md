# Task3: Zoo System

**This is an Object-Oriented Programming task. Copilot has generated a solution yet it still has several bugs. Please read the "Background" below carefully and finish the task.**
(This task is inspired by Dr. Shreya Kumarâ€™s Programming Paradigm Homework 4)

## Background

The Potawatomi Zoo needs to create an animal care/enclosure management system. The zoo may have hundreds of animals and needs to be able to scale with these quantities. The zoo keepers want to be able to access key information about different animals such as their conservation status and names. There should be functions that can display this information so the employees can access it faster.

### UML Tree

</p>

_(You only need to briefly read this UML Tree to understand the structure of the project)_

### Classes that you need to know:

- **ZooSystem:** Handles and performs operations determined by the user
- **Animal:** Contains the top most properties and methods common to all the animals in the zoo. The children of this class will be broken into three taxonomic classes. The three will be Mammalia, Aves, and Reptilia.
  Its attributes include `name`, `species`, `conservationStatus`, `chambersInHeart`, `eatingHabits`, and `bloodType`.
- **Mammal:** Child of `Animal` that contains the overarching traits of mammals.
  Its attribute is `furColor`.
- **Reptile:** Child of `Animal` that contains the overarching traits of reptiles.
  Its attributes include `scaleColor` and `eggSize`.
- **Lion:** Child of `Mammal` that contains the traits of Lions.
  This includes `maneSize`, `colorOfMane`, and `lionType`
- **Chameleon:** Child of Reptile that contains the traits of Chameleon.
  Its attribute includes `chameleonType`.

## Your Task:

Open **ZooSystem_Raw** folder. Github Copilot wrote some methods in this problem. However, there are many bugs in it. Please find and fix those problems so that you can get the same output as expected output.

**When you finished each subtask `Chameleon.java`, `Lion.java` and `ZooSystem.java`, please let the interviewer know.**

1. Go to **Chameleon.java Line 26**
   **Task3.1:** Copilot created a method called `changeScaleColor()` to set `scaleColor` to a random color and print out the color. Please find the bug in the method and fix it.

2. Go to **Lion.java Line 7**
   **Task3.2:** Copilot created two constructors for the `Lion` class that takes in the following parameters:
   one only takes `name` as input;
   the other takes `name`, `maneSize`, `colorOfMane` and `lionType` as input.
   Please find the bug in the method and fix it. You can refer to the UML Tree.
   **Default value:**

- `species="Lion"`
- `sonservationStatus="Vulnerable"`
- `eatingHabits="Carnivore" `
- `furColor="Yellow-Gold"`
- `maneSize=1.5`
- `colorOfMane="Brown"`
- `lionType="Barbary"`

3.  Go to **ZooSystem.java Line 217 and Line 464**
    **Task 3.3:** Copilot wrote a function called `searchAnimal(String  attribute, String  value, Animal[] alist)` to search for all the animals that matches the given `value` of the `attribute` (e.g. `Name`, `Species`, `Conservation Status`, `Heart Chambers`, `Eating Habits`) and display all the animals with that attribute with `printVerboseList(Animal[] list)` function
    please find the bug in the method and fix it.
